## Godot Theme for JetBrains IDEs (PyCharm, IntelliJ, etc.)
This theme is built on top of [One Dark](https://github.com/one-dark/jetbrains-one-dark-theme). It was used as the base theme, and then it was modified to look more like the Godot editor.

## Install
This theme is currently being reviewed by the JetBrains team. Once it has been approved, you should be able to find and install it through the JetBrains [plugins search page](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/search?headline=164-theme&tags=Theme).
